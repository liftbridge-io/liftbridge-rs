# liftbridge-rs
Liftbridge client for Rust language. 

## Protobuf definitions
Currently protobuf definitions are copied from the [liftbridge-api](https://github.com/liftbridge-io/liftbridge-api/blob/master/api.proto)  
repo and their rust representation is generated on build and auto-included.

## Credits
The initial work on this client was generously sponsored by [Tribe Health Solutions Inc.](http://tribehealthsolutions.com).
